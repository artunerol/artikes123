Hi, I'm Artun Erol

Mobile app development is exciting me. Iâ€™ve been teaching Swift to myself for 8 months by taking online courses and building projects in iOS. After taking Swift courses for 3 months, I started to build my own social media app from the scratch. This app has many functions as; creating a user in Firebase Database, functional searchbar to find a user by username, following a user and showing their posts in the main feed, capturing a video & posting it, and so on. Following a self improve based journey has taught me how to organize and build an app from the scratch with an entrepreneur mindset. 

You can check out my simple app project.
